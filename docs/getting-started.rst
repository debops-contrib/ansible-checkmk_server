Getting started
===============

.. contents::
   :local:

By default Check_MK server is installed from the `check-mk-raw` Debian package
as provided by Mathias Kettner upstream. It includes the :program:`omd` tool
which is used for managing the monitoring sites. The role will create a default
site called 'debops'. After the setup it can be reached by accessing
``https://<fqdn>/check_mk/debops``.

Example inventory
-----------------

You can install Check_MK server on a host by adding it to the
``[debops_service_checkmk_server]`` host group in your Ansible inventory::

    [debops_service_checkmk_server]
    hostname

Example playbook
----------------

Here's an example playbook that uses the ``debops-contrib.checkmk_server`` role
to install Check_MK server:

.. literalinclude:: playbooks/checkmk_server.yml
   :language: yaml

The inclusion of the ``debops.ferm`` is optional. This playbooks is shipped
with this role under :file:`docs/playbooks/checkmk_server.yml` from which you
can symlink it to your playbook directory.


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after host is first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration has not been changed.

Available role tags:

``role::checkmk_server``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.

``role::checkmk_server:rules``
  Execute tasks which are generating the monitoring rules definitions.

``role::checkmk_server:multisite``
  Execute tasks which configure the Check_MK multisite Web interface.

``role::checkmk_server:mkp``
  Execute tasks to install Check_MK packages.
