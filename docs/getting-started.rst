Getting started
===============

An example playbook which uses ``debops.checkmk_server`` role::

    ---

    - name: Manage Check_MK server
      hosts: [ 'debops_service_checkmk_server', 'debops_checkmk_server' ]
      become: True

      roles:
        - role: debops.checkmk_server
          tags: [ 'role::checkmk_server' ]

This playbook will install the ``check_mk_raw`` package along with its dependencies,
and configure a minimal monitoring service with default values generated by Ansible.
