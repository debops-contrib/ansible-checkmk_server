Default variables: configuration
================================

Some of the ``debops.checkmk_server`` default variables have more extensive
configuration than simple strings or lists, here you can find documentation
and examples for them.

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


.. _checkmk_server__ref_omd_config:

checkmk_server__omd_config
--------------------------

:program:`omd` is a command line utility which is used to manage Check_MK
monitoring sites. Some basic configuration options of the site will be
set via this tool. These options are defined in
:envvar:`checkmk_server__omd_config` which is a list of YAML dictionaries,
each with two key/value pairs defining the OMD property to be set. One key
has to be ``var`` with the variable name to be set as value. The other
key has to be ``value`` with the variable value to be set as value.

See :envvar:`checkmk_server__omd_config_core` for an example.


.. _checkmk_server__sshkeys:

checkmk_server__sshkeys
-----------------------

This configuration variable indicates if SSH keys should be configured for
accessing the Check_MK agent. If set to a non-empty value a additional
Check_MK host tag "Check_MK Agent via SSH" is configured and the SSH public
key is set as Ansible fact, so that it can be used by the
``debops.checkmk_agent`` role to configure SSH-based agent access. The
``checkmk_server__sshkeys`` variable is a dictionary which support the
following keys:

``generate_keypair``
  Generate a new SSH keypair for the Check_MK site user. Possible values:
  ``True`` or ``False``

``keysize``
  Specify the number of bits used when generating a new keypair. Only valid
  when ``generate_keypair`` is set to ``True``. Defaults to ``4096``.

``privatekey_file``
  Pre-generated SSH private key file which should be configured for SSH-based
  Check_MK agent access.

``publickey_file``
  Pre-generated SSH public key file. Must be the public key of the private
  key set with ``privatekey_file``.


.. _checkmk_server__site_packages:

checkmk_server__site_packages
-----------------------------

Check_MK has a plugin system where site customizations such as additional
checks can be installed. This is done via ``.mkp`` packages. For more
information see the upstream documentation about `Check_MK extension packages`_.

.. _Check_MK extension packages: https://mathias-kettner.com/cms_mkps.html

Packages which should be installed for the current Check_MK site are defined
as a list of YAML dictionaries with the following configuration keys. One of
``path`` or ``url`` must be given:

.. _checkmk_server__multisite_user_connections_example:

Example
~~~~~~~

Small example configuration for user authentication via LDAP showing the use
of some LDAP plugins::

    checkmk_server__multisite_user_connections:
      - server: 'localhost'
        binddn: 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com'
        bindpw: 'secret'
        group_dn: 'ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com'
        user_dn: 'ou=users,dc=example,dc=com'
        user_filter: '(objectclass=posixAccount)'
        active_plugins:
          alias:
            attr: 'gecos'
          groups_to_roles:
            admin:
              - group_dn: 'cn=wato-admin,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com'

This will synchronize all users in from the DN ``ou=users,dc=example,dc=com``
to WATO, fills the user's alias property with the value from the ``gecos``
LDAP attribute and assign the admin role to the members of the 'wato-admin'
group.


.. _checkmk_server__ref_distributed_sites:

checkmk_server__distributed_sites
---------------------------------

This setting will define Check_MK multisite connections to other Check_MK
monitoring sites. Each site entry is a nested YAML dictionary with the site
name as top key. The following sub keys are supported as site properties.

``alias``
  An alias or description of the site, required.

``disabled``
  Optional. Temporarily disable this connection. Defaults to ``False``.

``disable_wato``
  Optional. Disable configuration via WATO on this site. Defaults to ``True``.

``insecure``
  Optional. Ignore SSL certificate errors. Defaults to ``False``.

``multisiteurl``
  Optional. URL of the remote Check_MK site including ``/check_mk/``. This
  will be used by the main site to fetch resources from this site.

``password``
  Optional. User password for user defined in ``item.username`` used for
  authentication on this site.

``persist``
  Optional. Use persistent connections to this site. Defaults to ``False``.

``replicate_ec``
  Optional. Replicate Event Console configuration to this site. Defaults to
  ``False``.

``replicate_mkps``
  Optional. Replicate extensions (MKPs and files in :file:`~/local/`).
  Defaults to ``True``.

``replication``
  Optional. WATO replication allows you to manage several monitoring sites
  with a logically centralized WATO. Slave sites receive their configuration
  from master sites. By default this value is unset which means that the there
  is no replication with this site. Set this to ``slave`` to enable
  configuration push to this site.

``socket``
  Optional. Livestatus connection socket. By default this value is unset which
  corresponds to the local site. In case this is a foreign site on localhost
  or a remote site, this value must be set to a TCP or UNIX socket such as
  ``tcp:<hostname>:<port>`` or ``unix:<path>``. When connecting to remote site
  make sure that Livestatus over TCP is activated there.

``status_host``
  Optional. By specifying a status host for each non-local connection you
  prevent Multisite from running into timeouts when remote sites do not
  respond. The value must be specified as ``[ '<site>', '<hostname>' ]``.
  By default this value is unset. Check the `upstream documentation`_ for
  more information.

.. _upstream documentation: https://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_multisite_statushost.html

``timeout``
  Optional. Connect timeout in seconds before this site is considered to be
  unreachable. Defaults to ``10``.

``url_prefix``
  Optional. The URL prefix will be prepended to links of addons like
  PNP4Nagios or the classical Icinga GUI when a link to such applications
  points to a host or service on that site.

``username``
  Optional. User name used to synchronize configuration data with this site
  in case ``item.replication`` is set to ``slave``. Defaults to ``sitesync``.

``user_login``
  Optional. Allow users to directly directly login into the Web GUI of this
  site. Defaults to ``True``.

The default values for the distributed sites configuration are defined in
:envvar:`checkmk_server__distributed_sites_defaults` and can be overwritten
via Ansible inventory.
